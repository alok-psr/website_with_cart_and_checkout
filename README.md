# website_with_cart_and_checkout
This is a frontend-only project made using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JavaScript. 

## Theme
E-commerce website that fetches products from an API for product name, price, and image. The following API from freeapi.app is used to fetch the data: [Free API](https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/public/randomproducts?page=1&limit=100&inc=category%252Cprice%252Cthumbnail%252Cimages%252Ctitle%252Cid&query=smartphones').
the image of the product was not available from the api so i just hardcoded a random img  url (enjoy the hamsters üêπ)

## Project Sections

  1] a landing page: you can browse all the products or select category-wise from a category selector below the navbar at the top 
  
  2] wishlist/cart page: it contains all the products that you have added to the cart on your product page
  
  3] checkout popup: you can pay using a card or UPI whichever you prefer (tho they have not been linked to a payment gateway)
